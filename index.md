We're going with the [circular layout](/ap-audio-site/circle.html).

Per Marios' suggestion, I've added the title *GIOTPOR* in the centre of of the layout and made some adjustments to the chyron at the bottom and the background colours. On smaller screens, the layout switches to a simplified list view. The order of this list will be randomised to avoid the suggestion of hierarchy.

Hey Marios & AP folk,

as discussed on Friday, here are some layout prototypes for the Art Licks sound exhibition website:

- [Random Positioning](/ap-audio-site/random.html)
- [Grid](/ap-audio-site/grid.html)
- [Circle](/ap-audio-site/circle.html)

I think random positioning is the most successful, especially as it will work with whatever number of tracks will be on the website (Following Marios' sketches).

I've taken the liberty to add the coloured background to make things a bit more visually engaging. The idea here is that the blob would react in some subtle way with the sound (maybe pulsating). The colours I've chosen are essentially arbitrary, maybe Marios could pick some colour combinations to go with particular tracks? Or, of course, we could do something else entirely.

The typeface is [Sporting Grotesque](https://velvetyne.fr/fonts/sporting-grotesque/), which is free (so no licensing issues).

Let me know what you think.
